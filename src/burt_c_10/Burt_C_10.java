// A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.  You can refer to programming challenge 13 on page 316 in the textbook for more details.

// Write a Java program that finds prime numbers:
// 1. Create a method called isPrime that accepts an Integer value and returns true if it is prime and false if it is not.
// 2. In your main method, write a loop that that calls the method and passes it values from 1 to 100.
// 3. This loop should display all of the values that are prime.
